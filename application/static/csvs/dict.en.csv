services.description.biting$Cyclists – postmen – waitresses on cafés – other male dogs - all often pose a significant threat to your well-being. How do you know if that’s the case? You usually don’t! But don’t worry - I can tell. No more barging into your personal space. No more hello-saying. I start by barking and growling. In this way I also prevent them from trying to negotiate.  If they keep approaching I bite. You will not be bothered by uninvited (or invited) guests ever again.
services.description.digging$Critters often live in holes. I help you dig them out. As a bonus service I decorate your furniture with fresh dirt straight from the wilderness.
services.description.barking$Enemies can oftentimes be warded off from a distance with no need to bite them. This, however, requires wit, persistence and volume – in all of which I excel. I can bark directly from my leash, from your garden fence (this works particularly well with neighbours and large vehicles) or from the comfort of your home. I can hear them coming from miles away. And they can hear me.
services.description.pulling$Who doesn’t want a helping hand (or four helping legs) for pushing forward more quickly? Combine with skateboard at your own risk.
services.description.ballreminders$Oops! I seem to have dropped something on your laptop. We'd better remove it, right? (and throw it as far away as possible)<br>Humans, like the rest of us, occasionally need help sorting out their priorities. I can help with that. More time for the important things in life, you dig?
services.description.chilling$The reason we’re all here. Innit!
services.introduction$Everyday life is full of dangerous animals. You may not agree. You may not be aware. The fact is that many animals coming your way are secretly out to get you. I take care of it, thus creating more time for all the enjoyable things - ball-throwing, power-walking or cozying up in the sofa.
