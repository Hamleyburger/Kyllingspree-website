                Enemies can oftentimes be warded off from a distance with no need to bite them. This, however, requires wit, persistence and volume â€“ in all of which I excel. I can bark directly from my leash, from your garden fence (this works particularly well with neighbours and large vehicles) or from the comfort of your home. I can hear them coming from miles away. And they can hear me.
